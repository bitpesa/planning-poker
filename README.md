Planning poker app for slack, accessible with /poker in engineering.

Some functionality still needed:

- Zero needed to be added as a choice
- Error handling for unhappy paths
- Display the poker session name and average vote on a new line after completing
- Functionality to vote in days for timeboxing as well
